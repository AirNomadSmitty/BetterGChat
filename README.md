# BetterGChat

A quick extension to replace Twitch, [BTTV](https://nightdev.com/betterttv/), and [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) codes in a google hangouts popout chat window. This is the full extension, so it should be manageable with minimal coding experience.

## Usage

Open up the extension options page and add your twitch client ID and any more channels you want the extension to pull from. It'll pull in their twitch emotes, as well as FFZ and BTTV emotes. Without a twitch client ID you can still get the FFZ and BTTV emotes.

Open a GChat window through mail.google.com and OMEGALUL to your heart's content.
